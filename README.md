## MODULE 1

### MODULE 1 - VIDEO 1

**Learnings:**

Learned that LangGraph addresses the limitation of language models due to lack of access to tools, external context like documentation.                 
The video explained how basic language models are limited in their capabilities and it introduced the concept of control flow.                          
Learned about chain and agent architecture.                                                                                                           

( No changes and code files since the video was entirely theoretical. )

( Modified Graph with extra node. )

**Learnings:**

Learned to use the LangGraph library to build simple graphs.                                                                                         
Learned about the StateGraph, START, END to build and manage the graph.                                                                           
Learned how to connect nodes from START and EDGE.                                                                          
Learned how invoke function is used for execution from START.

**Changes:**

Added an extra node in the simple graph.                                                                                                           
Changed the probability to 1/3 because of the added node.                                                                                          
Gave the new node the state of "bored" which can be seen in the code file and its output.

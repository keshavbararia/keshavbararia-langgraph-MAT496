## MODULE 1

### MODULE 1 - VIDEO 1

**Learnings:**

Learned that LangGraph addresses the limitation of language models due to lack of access to tools, external context like documentation.                 
The video explained how basic language models are limited in their capabilities and it introduced the concept of control flow.                          
Learned about chain and agent architecture.                                                                                                           

( No changes and code files since the video was entirely theoretical. )
